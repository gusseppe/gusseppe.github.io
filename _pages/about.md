## 👨‍💻 AI Research Engineer with Hacking skills 💻
### Continual Learning for Agents | Trustworthy AI | MLOps

Hi there! I'm Gusseppe Bravo, a passionate AI Research Engineer with several years of experience working on Production ML systems, Continual Learning, Trustworthy AI, AI agents and MLOps. I am currently working at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, where I get to work with one of the world's top supercomputers.

### 🤝 Collaboration

Currently, I'm collaborating with Lenovo (USA) in Continual Learning and Trustworthy AI.

Also, I'm an intern PhD student at Emory University, developing a cognitive architecture for diabetic retinopathy models.

### 💻 Skills
My expertise lies in Python, Spark, Java and C++ development for AI algorithms, MLOps, Numerical Analysis, Data Science, and Big Data. Linux is my virtual home.

### 🔬 Experience
- Continual Learning, Domain Incremental learning.
- Debugging Machine Learning models using AutoEncoders, Active Learning, and Interactive ML.
- Trustworthiness: Drift detection using Trust scores. 
- Multiagents: Applied to Monitoring, Checking and Planning of ML models.
- Language agents: Cognitive architectures for custom tasks (e.g, Monitoring ML models). 
- MLOps: Custom implementations for Pipeline development, CI/CD, Serving and Monitoring.

### 🌟 Personal Goal
I dream of creating an AI system that learns to adapt to different scenarios in real-time, just as humans adapt to situations naturally.
